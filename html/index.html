        <h2>Welcome to Hall of Sonic!</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my sonic fan website! This is a website made purely for
          fun, and with the goal of making a fun "encyclopedia" type of thing
          filled with stuff sonic fans of all kinds can enjoy! "By the mania,
          for the mania" if you will.
        </p>
        <p>
          This site will contain information and trivia for everything sonic!
          Keep in mind, this will be focused primarily on the video games, not
          the TV shows or comics. Aside from that, no stone will be unturned!
        </p>

        <h2>What is there to do?</h2>
        <p>
          I have a few interesting plans for this website. First off, you can go
          to the character page and see all the fun and interesting characters
          made throughout the sonic series! You can also move onto the games
          page and see all sonic games that came out from 1991 to now, and there
          will be other functionalities soon to come!
